###Peer to peer file sharing via mobile phones

##Abstract

As per a statistic people spends over 162 minutes on mobile devices per day. Using Ensemble mobile devices such as smart mobile devices, laptops and any other embedded software devices for personal entertainment is fashion now days. All these devices are equipped with technologies such as Wireless Fidelity (Wi-Fi), Bluetooth, etc. The use of Peer-to-Peer (P2P) protocols and its applications is becoming popular over these mobile devices which permit wide number of users to share their own content such as audio, video, data, etc. Moreover people can share files by passing it to each other. However such content sharing faces several challenges such as limited bandwidth and communication range. This paper mainly discuss about the study of P2P sharing on ensemble mobile devices using either of the technologies. It also discusses the challenges and problems regarding the range and bandwidth while sharing contents.
